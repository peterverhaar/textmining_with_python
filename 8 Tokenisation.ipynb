    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative analyses of texts are often based initially on counts of the smaller linguistic units that occur within texts, such as the words, the paragraph, or the sentences. The process of dividing a text into such smaller components is referred to as tokenisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word tokenisation generally takes place on the basis of the spaces that occur in between the words. The individual words that are found in a text are called “**tokens**\". When this full list is deduplicated, leaving only the unique words, the items in such lists are called “**types**”. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial explains how you can tokenise a text using the `nltk` package, a toolkit that enables you you work with texts in natural languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make use of this package, you firstly need to import it."
