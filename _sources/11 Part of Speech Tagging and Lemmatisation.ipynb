    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing is an interdisciplinary area of research bringing together insights from fields such as artifical intelligence, computational linguistics, statistics and computer science. The aim of NLP is to enable computers to understand and to process the natural langauges that are spoken and written by human beings. Researchers in the field of NLP have developed sophisticated tools and algorithms for machine translation, document summarisation and sentiment analysis. This notebook explains two specific preprocessing task in NLP: Part of speech tagging and Lemmatisation."

    "Part of speech (POS) taggers are applications which can produce data about the syntactic categories of words. They can create labels such as 'noun', 'adjecvive', 'adverb' or 'determiner' for the words in a text. Using such POS taggers, we can also extract words in specific syntactic categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have imported the `nltk` library, you can generate such POS tags by making use of the `pos_tag()` method. This method demands a list of words as a parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "`pos_tag()` is typically used in combination with a word tokenisation method such as `word_tokenize`. The output of this latter function can then be used as input to the `pos_tag()` method."
