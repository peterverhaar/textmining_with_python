    "Is the number of positive words higher than the number of than negative words?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can the steps below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two lists, named `positive_words` and `negative_words`.\n",
    "2. Tokenise the text file, and calculate the score for positivity and the score for negativity for each of these words. \n",
    "3. If the positivity score is higher than 0.75, append the word to the list named `positive_words`. If the negativitiy score is higher than 0.75, append the word to `negative_words`.\n",
    "4. Finally, you can subtract the length of the list `negative_words` from the length of the list `positive_words`"
